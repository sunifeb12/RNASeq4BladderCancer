Genetic mutations are known to cause malignant cancer. 

This study, an attempt has been made to characterize gene expression patterns by leveraging computational pipeline. 


Three pairs of human bladder cancer tissues compared with equivalent normal bladder tissues. 


To quantify gene expression in an RNA-seq dataset, reads generated from the sequencing step are mapped to a reference genome. 


 

To identify the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components gene ontology enrichment analysis is performed.

Characteristics of these specific DEGs and their Pathway, Transcription Factor, Kinase, and miRNA enrichment analysis might lead to the significance of these DEGs in human bladder cancer.
